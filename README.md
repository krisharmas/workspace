Files used to set up terminal look and feel

This repo houses files that are used to set up the terminal the way I like it.

Mac OS X
--------
On Mac, while the default terminal is okay, the terminal I have chosen is
iTerm2. A repo has also been incuded here for iTerm2 colorschemes. At the time
of writing this README my preferred colorscheme was Novel.


Dotfiles
--------
In the directory dotfiles/ there are hidden files such as .bashrc, .aliases, and
.vimrc to set up the workspace they way I like it. The terminal in Mac OS X is
different than in linux so the dotfiles for each are separated into dotfiles/mac
and dotfiles/linux.


Vim
---
The vim/ directory contains a repository that contains colorschemes for vim. At
the time of writing this README my preferred colorscheme was solarized with a
dark background. The light background is also nice. Those fields have already
been set in the .vimrc in the dotfiles/ directory.
